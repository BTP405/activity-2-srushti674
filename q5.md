#Approach 1

def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

Approach 1 (doubleL):
Defines a function doubleL(n) that creates a list by iterating over the range 0 to n-1 and appending each element multiplied by 2. The function returns the list, and an outer loop prints the elements with ' : ' as a separator.

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

Approach 2:
It uses a list comprehension to create a list [n * 2 for n in range(5)]. It iterates over the range from 0 to 4 (specified by range(5)) and multiplies each element by 2. The resulting list is then iterated over using a for loop, and each element is printed with a separator of ' : '.

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

Approach 3 (doubleG):
This program defines a generator function doubleG(n) using the yield keyword. It iterates over the range from 0 to n-1, yielding the result of i * 2 one at a time. The for loop outside the function iterates over the values yielded by the generator and prints them with a separator of ' : '.


2.
The function doubleG(n) in Approach 3 is a generator function. The advantage of using a generator function is its memory efficiency. Generators produce values on-the-fly, only when requested. This is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets, as it minimizes resource consumption by generating values only when needed during iteration. The generator function reduces overhead, providing a more memory-efficient solution for sequential processing compared to creating and storing a complete list.
